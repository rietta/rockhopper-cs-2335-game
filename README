1.1 Acknowledgements
-------------------------------------------
Much thanks goes to both Ronald Ning
and Frank Rietta in creating this game. 
Without their work none of this would be possible.

Ron spent many hours constructing the interface graphics,
and stitching the various components together.  Frank brought
the game to life by creating the Maze handlers, interactions, "AI" for
the bugs, and the XML level loader.

-------------------------------------------
1.1. Overview
-------------------------------------------

RockHopper is a clone of the popular Boulder Dash
console video game from the 1980s.  You are Rockford,
an enterprising spelunker.  Evil fiends have kidnapped the 
Govenors' daughter and stole her away into the Stagtite mountains. 
It is your task to brave the caves deep reccesses and rescue the 
girl, while avoiding the many lurking dangers.

Use the arrow keys to move around the map,
push boulders asside, and collect gold.

-------------------------------------------
1.2. Starting a new Game
-------------------------------------------

From the command line:

java RockHopper 
or
java RockHopper [level file]

RockHopper levels are stored in XML text files.  When you start the game you 
specify the level you want to load as the parameter.  If no level is specified,
the game will default to level1.xml.

Chapter 2: Navigating the Menus

-------------------------------------------
1.1. The Menus
-------------------------------------------

Rockhopper has the following menu options:

File
	-> New Game: File Chooser Dialog for Selecting an XML Level
	-> Reset Level: Restarts the current level from scratch 
						(good if you loose and want a retry).
	-> Exit: Closes the Game

Options
	-> Go to the previous level: Loads the previous level (as specified in the active level file).
	-> Go to the next level: Loads the next level (as specified in the active level file).
	
	Sidebar 1: Explaination:
	
	Each level file is an XML document.  The file contains map information and
	other meta data.  A valid level file will have  "Previous Level" and "Next Level"
	tags, which specify the name of the XML config files for the last and next level.
	(Think of it as a file based linked list).
	
Help
	-> How to Play: Shows a ledger of the game sprites, and enemies.
	-> About: The mandatory, flashy, but otherwise useless box.

-------------------------------------------
1.2. The Status Area
-------------------------------------------

Under the map, three progress bars show your active
stats in the game.

Gold got: [===4/9====]   [  ===     ]   Time left: [====45 secs ]

The first bar shows the percentage of gold you have collected
to the amount required to reveal the exit; once the bar reaches 100%
a door will appear and you can leave the current level.

The second bar is a really cool star trek/knight rider affect that shows
that your computer is alive.

The third bar shows how much time you have left to complete the level,
if it reaches 0, you die.

-------------------------------------------
1.3. Moving Around the Board
-------------------------------------------

Use the arrow keys to move around the board.
Dig out dirt, move boulders, and collect the gold to
reveal the hidden exit.  Take care, because one wrong
move to mean sudden death as the cave can easily
collapse around you.
